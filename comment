there is a medical emergency at home—my grandfather’s health has gotten much worse over the past few days, and he is now in a critical condition. I will need to take a week off starting tomorrow to be with my family during this time.

I’m aware there were plans for a visit to the Hyderabad location this week; however, due to the situation, I may not be available.
