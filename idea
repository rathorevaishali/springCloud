Conscientiousness:
Sudhir showed enthusiasm in taking up tasks, though with closer attention to timelines and proactive follow-ups, he can improve his reliability further.

Divisional Knowledge:
He made good progress in learning the technical aspects but would benefit from gaining more context on how our work aligns with the broader division goals.

Intellectual Curiosity:
Sudhir focused well on his assigned tasks. With a bit more curiosity about surrounding systems, he can enhance his overall understanding and impact.

Action Plan:
Assign a mentor for regular guidance, provide a short overview of the divisionâ€™s mission, and encourage participation in team demos or tech talks to deepen his context and engagement.
