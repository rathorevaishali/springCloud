 I wanted to check if it would be possible to extend my leave, as my grandfather passed away last week and I am currently in my village with limited network access. Some of the final rituals and responsibilities are still ongoing, and I may need a few more days here.

Please let me know if a short extension is manageable from the teamâ€™s side. I will ensure a smooth transition and catch up on work once I return.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
Vaishali Rathore
