I would like to inquire about the family care leave policy. Initially, my grandfather was in the ICU, and unfortunately,
he has recently passed away. I would like to understand if 
I can avail family care leave in this situation and for how many days it can be taken.

Please also let me know if any supporting documents are required from my side for the leave application.

Best regards,
Vaishali Rathore
